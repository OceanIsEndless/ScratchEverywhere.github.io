# Installation

Scratch Everywhere! is Homebrew software and requires a hacked/modded console.
There are two methods to install the runtime:

- Download the release or nightly build (easy)
- Build the file yourself (harder)

> [!WARNING] Disclaimer
> Nightly builds may be more unstable than releases and should probably only be
> used if you are instructed to do so in a bug report or you know exactly what
> using nightlies implies.

## Get up and running for 3DS

Download the `.3dsx` file in the Releases tab or
[nightly build](https://nightly.link/ScratchEverywhere/ScratchEverywhere/workflows/nightly-3ds/main/Scratch%20Everywhere!%203DS%20Nightly.zip).

- Place the `.3dsx` file in the `3ds/` folder of your 3DS SD card, along with
  any Scratch projects you want to run.

> [!NOTE]
> Scratch Everywhere! is also on Universal Updater, so you can just download it
> there and keep it updated that way!

Then it should be as simple as opening the Homebrew Launcher on your 3DS and
running the app!
